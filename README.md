# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was a project where we go over the basics in HTML, CSS, Git, Java, and web design 

My motivation during this project comes from trying to learn and better understand the world of coding. Also to be prepared for my coding bootcamp and make sure I'm well prepared.

The reason I built this project was to work with all types of languages and learn the basics in HTML, CSS, Java and Git.

The problems this project solves is helping me better my skills in the coding world in several different languages.

I learned the basics of multiple different languages and understand coding more.
